## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I feel I learned many small (yet important) things. 

- I was able to provide customized buttons without hampering focusablity of the elements.
- I used the accessibility check on Firefox developer tool to identify some violation to the WCAG compliance.
- I tried to implment the form validation in a more streamlined and generic way than my previous attemp. I think it has become a bit simpler and robust, but it needs more work.

### Continued development

I still struggle to have the form working correctly with issues related to validation, visual feedbacks, and accessibility supports. I need more practice.
